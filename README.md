# Final Assignment - CSC317

This repository contains my implementation of the final assignment for CSC317, which combines our group project with the personal portfolio developed throughout the semester.

Due to a systemic issue during a Git push, my original repository—which included all previous assignments—became disorganized, with files from various assignments getting mixed together. To ensure clarity for the grader, professor, and future job interviews, I created this new repository specifically for the final assignment. This clean setup allows my work to be reviewed and presented more effectively.

Here is my original Github repository with all the previous assignments for reference: https://github.com/HSahraye/CSC317.git
