## Student Information
- **Name:** Hamid Sahraye
- **Course:** CSC317
- **Assignment:** Final Project - Portfolio Integration
- **Submission Date:** May 19, 2024

## Overview
This submission represents the integration of my group project (Assignment 5 - Recipe App) into my personal portfolio website. The portfolio showcases my work throughout the semester, including the JavaScript Calculator (Assignment 4) and the collaborative Recipe App project. 

I had to create a new repository for the final assignment because I somehow restructured everything in my original repository which made everything completely unorganized. 

My original GitHub Repository link with All my Projects from this semester: (https://github.com/HSahraye/CSC317.git)

The new repository I created to make the Final Assignment organized for the grader, professor, and Job interviews.
